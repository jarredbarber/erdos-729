This is mathematically false because as $P$ increases, the divisibility constraint becomes weaker (vacuously true for $p > P$ if $a, b, n \\le P$), allowing $a$ and $b$ to grow up to $P$ while $n$ remains $0$. A fixed $C$ cannot bound $a+b$ in this case.\n2. **Absence of Constant Term**: The bound $(a+b) \\le n + C \\log(n+1)$ forces $a+b=0$ when $n=0$ (since $\\log(1)=0$). However, $1!1! \\mid 0!$ is true (as $0!=1$), so $a=1, b=1, n=0$ is a valid counterexample for any $C$.\n3. **Asymptotic Interpretation**: The problem specifies $a+b \\le n + O(\\log n)$.
