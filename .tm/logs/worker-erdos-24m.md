> I've successfully derived the key alternative form of Legendre's Formula. I started with the standard formula and proceeded by representing n in base p. I have then computed the p-adic valuation of $n!$, re-indexed, and applied the formula for geometric series. The result is the desired expression, which should make the proof easier to comprehend.
