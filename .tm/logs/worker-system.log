[2026-02-07T05:22:47.990Z]    Summary: Decomposed Erdős factorial divisibility conjecture into 9-task DAG with clear execution path
[2026-02-07T05:22:47.990Z]    Details: Created a complete task decomposition following all 6 phases:

**Phase 1 (erdos-csg)**: Natural language proof in PROOF.md - READY
**Phase 2 (erdos-d2f)**: Formalize theorem statement in Lean with sorry - READY
**Phase 3 (erdos-vxn)**: Verify statement matches problem - depends on Phase 2
**Phase 4**: Two parallel lemmas:
  - 4.1 (erdos-lnq): Prove Legendre formula lemma - depends on Phase 3
  - 4.2 (erdos-lgm): Prove large primes domination - depends on Phase 3
  - Verification tasks (erdos-vs2, erdos-typ) for each lemma
**Phase 5 (erdos-89x)**: Assemble final proof - depends on verified lemmas
**Phase 6 (erdos-10y)**: Final verification of all success criteria - Priority 0

All Lean tasks include testCommand 'lake build'. No sorry allowed in final proof.

**Strategy Document**: Created STRATEGY.md with complete proof approach, dependency graph, and critical constraints.

**Key Insight**: Use Legendre's formula for p-adic valuations. For large primes p, if a!b!|n! then v_p(a!)+v_p(b!)≤v_p(n!), which via Legendre gives (a+b)/(p-1)≤n/(p-1)+O(log n). Taking p→∞ yields a+b≤n+O(log n).

**Ready to Execute**: Phase 1 and Phase 2 are unblocked and ready for execute agents.

**Deferred**: Old duplicate tasks (erdos-bv8, erdos-tib, erdos-2mk, erdos-juz, erdos-1qf) marked as deferred.

The key insight is choosing a prime q ≈ log n that is larger than P, then applying Legendre's formula to show the constraint from this single large prime is sufficient. The proof is structured with clear definitions, 3 preliminary lemmas, a formal theorem statement, a 5-step proof, and concludes with confidence level (HIGH) and assumptions.

📊 Task erdos-lgm failed:
[2026-02-07T05:35:56.611Z]    Summary: Cannot complete proof without Legendre formula bounds
[2026-02-07T05:35:56.611Z]    Details: ANALYSIS:

1. **What I proved**: Using Bertrand's postulate alone, I can show a + b ≤ 4n. Specifically:
   - If min(a,b) > 2n, there exists a prime p with n < p ≤ 2n that violates the divisibility condition
   - Therefore min(a,b) ≤ 2n and similarly max(a,b) ≤ 2n
   - This gives a + b ≤ 4n

2. **Why this is insufficient**: The theorem requires a + b ≤ n + C*log(n+1) for a universal constant C. The bound a + b ≤ 4n requires C ≥ 3n/log(n+1), which grows without bound, so no fixed C works.

3. **What's needed**: To get the O(log n) bound, I need explicit bounds on Legendre's formula:
   - Upper bound: v_p(m!) < m/(p-1)
   - Lower bound: v_p(m!) ≥ m/(p-1) - O(log m)
   
   With these, for a large enough prime p > max(P, a, b, n), the divisibility condition v_p(a!) + v_p(b!) ≤ v_p(n!) gives:
   (a+b)/(p-1) - O(log stuff) ≤ n/(p-1) + O(log n)
   
   Choosing p ≈ Θ(max(a,b,n)) carefully makes the error terms O(log n), yielding a + b ≤ n + O(log n).

4. **Dependency issue**: The task description says 'Using Legendre's formula (from task erdos-lnq)', but erdos-lnq is still in progress. These two tasks should either:
   - Have erdos-lgm depend on erdos-lnq (sequential), or
   - Have erdos-lgm prove its own Legendre bounds (requires significant additional work)

5. **Current code state**: Erdos/Basic.lean has helper lemmas using Bertrand's postulate and the main theorem with partial proof + sorries for the Legendre bounds.

RECOMMENDATION: Make erdos-lgm explicitly depend on erdos-lnq, or assign proving Legendre bounds as a separate subtask.

$ tm create -t "Advisor: Fix mathematical flaws in Lean theorem statement" -r advisor -p 0 --inherit-deps erdos-vxn -d "The current theorem statement in Erdos/Basic.lean is mathematically false and doesn't fully capture the problem requirements.

Issues found:
1. **Uniformity of C**: The statement uses '∃ C, ∀ P ≥ P₀', implying the constant C is independent of the set of ignored primes P. However, as P increases, the divisibility condition becomes weaker, allowing a and b to be up to P even when n=0. This makes a fixed C impossible. The correct quantification should likely be '∀ P, ∃ C'.
2. **Missing constant term**: The bound 'a + b ≤ n + C log(n+1)' forces a=b=0 when n=0. However, a=1, b=1, n=0 satisfies a!b!|n! (1*1 divides 1). A constant term or a larger log offset is needed.
3. **Implicit n bounds**: O(log n) notation usually applies for sufficiently large n. The formal statement should either handle the small n cases with a constant or use Asymptotics.IsBigO.

Please revise the theorem statement to be mathematically sound and faithful to the 'ignoring small primes' condition."

📊 Task erdos-vxn completed:
[2026-02-07T05:50:17.304Z]    Summary: Gaps found in Lean theorem statement; escalation to Advisor initiated.
[2026-02-07T05:50:17.304Z]    Details: The Lean theorem statement in `Erdos/Basic.lean` was verified against the `PROBLEM.md` requirements. While it correctly identifies the 'ignoring small primes' condition via the `IgnoresSmallPrimes` definition and uses a logarithmic bound, several mathematical and structural issues were identified:

1. **Incorrect Quantifier Ordering**: The statement `∃ C, ∀ P ≥ P₀, ...` implies a single constant $C$ works for all sets of ignored primes. This is mathematically false because as $P$ increases, the divisibility constraint becomes weaker (vacuously true for $p > P$ if $a, b, n \le P$), allowing $a$ and $b$ to grow up to $P$ while $n$ remains $0$. A fixed $C$ cannot bound $a+b$ in this case.
2. **Absence of Constant Term**: The bound $(a+b) \le n + C \log(n+1)$ forces $a+b=0$ when $n=0$ (since $\log(1)=0$). However, $1!1! \mid 0!$ is true (as $0!=1$), so $a=1, b=1, n=0$ is a valid counterexample for any $C$.
3. **Asymptotic Interpretation**: The problem specifies $a+b \le n + O(\log n)$. The current Lean statement interprets this as a global bound without a constant term $D$ or an 'eventually' clause ($n \ge n_0$).

I have created a priority 0 task (`erdos-sbx`) for the Advisor to fix these flaws before proof implementation begins.

📊 Task erdos-sbx completed:
[2026-02-07T05:51:51.615Z]    Summary: Fixed mathematical flaws in the Lean theorem statement and updated the natural language proof.
[2026-02-07T05:51:51.615Z]    Details: The theorem statement in `Erdos/Basic.lean` was revised to address three key issues:
1. **Uniformity of C**: Changed quantification to `∀ P, ∃ C`, correctly showing that the constant $C$ depends on the set of ignored primes $P$.
2. **Small n handling**: Replaced `log(n+1)` with `log(n+2)` and added a positive constant requirement for $C$ to ensure the bound $a+b \leq n + C \log(n+2)$ holds for all $n$, including $n=0$.
3. **Universal Quantification**: The theorem now correctly applies to all $a, b, n$ satisfying the divisibility condition for primes $p > P$.

Additionally, `PROOF.md` was updated to align its natural language proof with the refined formal statement, including a more rigorous treatment of the small $n$ cases and the choice of prime $q$ depending on $n$.
