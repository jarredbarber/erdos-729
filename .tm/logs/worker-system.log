{
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Proven Legendre's identity and inequality for factorial valuation in both natural language and Lean 4.",
  "details": "1. Implemented `Erdos/Legendre.lean` which contains:\n    - `legendre_equality`: The identity $(p-1) v_p(n!) = n - s_p(n)$, using Mathlib's `sub_one_mul_padicValNat_factorial`.\n    - `sum_digits_le_n`: Proof that $s_p(n) \le n$.\n    - `padicValNat_factorial_le_div`: Proof that $v_p(n!) \le n/(p-1)$.\n    - `length_digits_le_log`: Proof that the number of digits is bounded by $\\log_p n + 1$.\n    - `legendre_factorial_v2_bound`: Proof that $v_2(n!) = n - O(\\log n)$.\n2. Created `PROOF.md` with a detailed natural language proof of Legendre's formula and the logarithmic bound.\n3. Verified that the codebase compiles with `lake build` and contains no `sorry` statements.\n4. Confidence Level: HIGH."
