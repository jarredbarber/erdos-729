Erdős [Er68c] proved that if a!b!∣n! then a+b≤n+O(logn)

The proof is easy, and can be done with powers of 2 alone: 
Legendre's formula implies that if 2k is the highest power of 2 dividing n! then k=n+O(logn), and hence if a!b!∣n! then a+b≤n+O(logn).

This problem is asking if a!b!∣n! 'ignoring what happens on small primes' still implies a+b≤n+O(logn).

This has been proved in the affirmative by Barreto and Leeham, using ChatGPT and Aristotle
